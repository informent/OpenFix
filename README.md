# OpenFix

OpenFix is a read-only-first Windows health and troubleshooting tool.

It scans for useful evidence: system-drive space, temporary-file growth, network availability, startup inventory, activation status, and scan safety. It then explains what it found in plain language and calculates a transparent 0–100 health score.

## Support bundles

OpenFix 1.0 exports a self-contained ZIP for troubleshooting and handoff. Each bundle contains structured JSON, a standalone HTML report, a concise system summary, a privacy note, and a SHA-256 manifest. User-profile names and product-key-shaped values are redacted. OpenFix does not include file contents or make system changes while generating a bundle.

## Activation

OpenFix includes a **Fix activation** action that opens Windows' official Activation settings. It does not bypass licensing, hide activation notices, or modify protected licensing components.

## Principles

- Scan before changing anything
- Explain evidence and impact
- Preview repairs before applying them
- Keep changes reversible
- No account, telemetry, or cloud service required

## Build and test
